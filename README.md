This is unofficial and no one from Powercord will help you if the script has issues, just submit a report to [issues](https://github.com/dream-frame/powercord-installer/issues).

**This project was only made for fun and for those who are new to Linux and are total noobs.**

All scripts are put together by [Korbs](https://Twitter.com/KorbsStudio).

Just to be clear, **Powercord** only supports **Discord Canary**, for Stable and PTB you'll be using a fork of mine that is also unofficial.

## Linux

### Arch
There are no plans to create a script for Arch, Arch users aren't noobs

## Windows
There are no plans to create a GUI installer for Windows

You could try [PlugGUI](https://plug.creatable.cafe/) by Creatable.

## OSX
There are no plans to create a GUI installer for OSX

You could try [PlugGUI](https://plug.creatable.cafe/) by Creatable.

### To Do
- [x] Create GUI Installer
